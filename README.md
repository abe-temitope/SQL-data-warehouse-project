## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The project leverages a layered approach inspired by modern data engineering principles:
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Raw Data Layer**: Stores unprocessed data extracted directly from source systems, preserving its original state.
2. **Processed Data Layer**: Cleansed and structured data, ready for analytical workflows.
3. **Reporting Layer**: Organized and optimized data, modeled for generating meaningful insights through reports and dashboards.

## üìñ Project Highlights

### Key Components:
1. **Data Architecture**: Implementation of a modular design with distinct layers for storage, processing, and reporting.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Automated workflows for Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data from various sources into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Development of relational schemas (fact and dimension tables) for efficient analysis.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Insight generation using SQL-based reports to address key business questions.

üéØ Ideal for professionals aiming to demonstrate skills in:
- SQL Query Writing  
- ETL Development  
- Data Modeling and Design  
- Analytical Reporting

# About Me

I am Abe Temitope Moses, a data enthusiast with over 5 years of experience in data analytics and insights generation. My journey in data analysis has equipped me with skills in SQL, data modeling, and visualization. 

In this project, I have designed and implemented a **SQL Data Warehouse** to streamline the process of storing, querying, and analyzing large datasets. This warehouse demonstrates my proficiency in creating efficient, scalable solutions for handling data across diverse domains. Through the integration of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) pipelines, I ensured data integrity and accessibility for insightful decision-making.

Key highlights of the project:
- Expertise in advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques.
- Development of star and snowflake schemas for enhanced query performance.
- Utilization of best practices in database normalization and indexing.
- Focus on delivering actionable insights for business intelligence.

This project reflects my passion for solving complex problems and my commitment to using data as a tool to drive impactful decisions.
